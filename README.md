# meteor-boilerplate (forked)

Forked from [BeDifferential's meteor-boilerplate package](https://github.com/BeDifferential/meteor-boilerplate). This fork has a *local copy* of the [accounts-entry](https://github.com/BeDifferential/accounts-entry) package in the `./packages` directory. We're adding shipping address fields to the signup flow. *More info on [packages and versioning at eventedmind](https://www.eventedmind.com/feed/j8wSs7MHznPKiHmth.*

>A starting point for Meteor applications, based on CoffeeScript and used by BeDifferential to create apps for clients. Includes [Iron Router](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/iron-router), [Accounts-Entry](http://github.differential.io/accounts-entry/), Bootstrap 3, Font Awesome and LESS.
